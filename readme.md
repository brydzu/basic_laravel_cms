# Basic Laravel CMS

This is a basic Laravel CMS built on Laravel 5.3. This was constructed following the basic layout of Edwin Diaz's 'Laravel for Beginners' Course, with supplemental lessons from Jeffrey Way's Laracasts. 

Dashboard and Authentication uses Laravel Backpack Base. 

Includes Dashboard with ability to create, edit and delete posts, create, edit and delete Categories and assign them to posts, and add Tags to Posts, then sort by Tags on front end. 

Functionality to create Tags in admin will be coming soon.
